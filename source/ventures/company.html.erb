description: Myanmar’s leading retailer, innovating supply chains and creating thousands of jobs
bio: |
  CEO Win Win Tint took over her family’s grocery store in 1996, when she was just 21 years old. In the years that followed, she drove the business to expand through a period of political turmoil and renewed engagement with the world. Hers is a story of grit, determination, and deeply held belief in the potential of Myanmar’s economy. 

  City Mart is now Myanmar’s largest retail chain, by a long stretch. What began as a single store in 1996 has scaled to include retail chains across the country. The company now employs more than 7,500 and aims to serve all of Myanmar’s 52 million citizens. As the country’s retail sector enters a period of unprecedented expansion, City Mart is poised to grow with it. 
  
  As a market leader, City Mart understands and is driven by Myanmar’s unique consumer needs. As it grows, the company adheres to its mission: to be Myanmar’s standard of excellence in customer service, quality produce, and supply chain innovation. Because of the company’s values, drive, and commitment to meeting sustainable expansion, we are proud to count City Mart among Alter’s ventures.
