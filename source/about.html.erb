  heading: Where we work
  countries:
    - name: myanmar
      pretty_name: Myanmar
      meta: Leapfrogging Tech Innovation
      description: Political and economic reforms have turned Myanmar into one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. We see limitless potential in the country’s educated workforce that is dedicated to making good on the promise of newly opened markets. Myanmar is primed for the digital age.
    - name: haiti
      pretty_name: Haiti
      meta: Liberation from Aid
      description: Where foreign aid is failing, Alter’s entrepreneurs are successfully creating jobs and transforming their communities. Haiti boasts vast pools of talent and natural resources. We believe the right ventures can help pull the country’s economy away from cyclical poverty and reliance on outside assistance.
    - name: afghanistan
      pretty_name: Afghanistan
      meta: Peace Through Entrepreneurship
      description: Many outside observers see endless corruption and violence. We dug deeper and found an elite tier of Afghans leading businesses that buck the trend. They don’t rely on foreign aid. They refuse to bribe. And they turn strong profits. Alter’s entrepreneurs reach nation-wide to employ and empower their fellow citizens in this resource-rich nation.
    - name: cuba
      pretty_name: Cuba
      meta: Building Partnerships for Prosperity
      description: In a country that is flirting with a greater role for the private sector, we see the opportunity for entrepreneurial role-models to shape a nascent startup ecosystem. Our ventures in Cuba are well placed to set the tone for generations of entrepreneurs to come, and they’re building their businesses with some of the world’s greatest untapped human capital. Alter supports Cuban entrepreneurship in line with current US regulations.

  founders:
    - name: jesse
      pretty_name: Jesse Sullivan
      role: "Founder/CEO"
      link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsully3/
      bio: "I grew frustrated by my failed attempts to create change in the world’s toughest places through traditional charity, military, and government solutions. Alter was born out of a desire to bring together two radically different worlds: Silicon Valley, where the future is being created, and frontier markets, where many still struggle to survive."
    - name: ozair
      pretty_name: Ozair Ali
      role: "Co-Founder/COO"
      link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozairali/
      bio: I love solving puzzles - especially those with a purpose. The elimination of poverty is the puzzle I want to solve in my lifetime. I was born in a middle-class family in a developing country, but have been exceptionally fortunate to go to some of the best schools, and work across four continents in the public and private sector. With all of that, if I don't solve this puzzle, well, who will?
    - name: kimh
      pretty_name: Kim Horwitz
      role: "Chief of Staff"
      link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimhorwitz/
      bio: "From living and researching in some of the world's least developed places, I've learned that entrepreneurship is accomplishing what decades of cookie-cutter international aid programs have failed to do: stimulate sustainable economic opportunities from the ground up. It's an honor to help empower the ventures that are creating prosperity and opportunity in the parts of the world that need it most."
