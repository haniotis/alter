      role: "Co-Founder/CEO"
      bio: "At a young age, I made a promise to devote my life to serving children dying of basic needs. I grew frustrated by my failed attempts to create change in the world’s toughest places through traditional charity, military, and government solutions. Alter was born out of a desire to bring together two radically different worlds: Silicon Valley, where the future is being created, and frontier markets, where many still struggle to survive."
